art film either made national film preservation foundation says imdb says regardless exact date film definitely appears indicative general time period--with camera-work pop art stylings pure late s-early sthe film consists three simple images distorted using different weird camera tricks distorted images accompanied music absolutely dialog plot sort obviously intended almost like form performance art like performance art interesting first quickly becomes tiresome film put even bluntly total bore would appeal one perhaps made film family friends perhaps people hip understood us mortals
